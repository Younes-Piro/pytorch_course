# PyTorch Binary Classification Example: Moon Dataset

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various aspects of PyTorch, including an example of binary classification using the moon dataset.

## Introduction

In this project, we explore PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework, through practical examples and tutorials. The primary focus is on building and training neural networks for machine learning tasks.

## Notebooks

The following notebooks are included in this repository:

- `pytorch_introduction.ipynb`: Introduction to PyTorch, covering basics such as tensor manipulation.
- `pytorch_workflow.ipynb`: Demonstrates the workflow of training and evaluating models in PyTorch.
- `pytorch_classification.ipynb`: Example of binary and multiple classification using pytorch.
- `Moon_classification_exemple.ipynb`: Example of binary classification using moon dataset.

## Usage

To use these notebooks:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the desired notebook (e.g., `pytorch_classification.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
